# algorytm-6n-plus-minus-1
Implementation and analysis of a prime number generation algorithm based on 6n ± 1”.
The algorithm for generating prime numbers is based on mathematical patterns that use indices (instead of numerical values) to identify prime numbers. This allows for fast prime number generation using arithmetic sequences based on combinations of different types of numbers (odd and even). The entire approach is optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations and double loops.
